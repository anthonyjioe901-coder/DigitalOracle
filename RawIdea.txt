[20/10/2025 01:56] Tony Shelby: So you're thinking of creating engaging
[20/10/2025 01:56] Tony Shelby: I see, so you want to create something where people contribute money but also get value or returns back, not like a typical donation. What kind of benefit or gain are you thinking people would receive for participating?
[20/10/2025 01:57] Tony Shelby: I understand you want to create something where people can earn money back, but I'm a bit concerned about making it "look difficult" - that could come across as misleading to your audience. Could you help me understand what specific value or service you'd be providing that would justify people's investment and returns?
[20/10/2025 01:57] Tony Shelby: Ethical Business Models

Transparent value creation


Legitimate services


Clear benefits


Honest marketing


Sustainable returns
[20/10/2025 01:57] Tony Shelby: I see - you're thinking of creating a guessing game where people try to predict numbers, dates, letters, or words. How would people participate and what would they win if they guess correctly?

Prediction challenges


Public participation


Prize structure


Entry methods


Game mechanics
[20/10/2025 01:58] Tony Shelby: Let me recap what you've shared so far. You want to create something to get popular on TikTok using strange or random content to grab attention. Your goal is to get people engaged and eventually have them contribute money, but unlike cryptocurrency, participants would be able to gain money back as a benefit. You want me to help create a logic that makes it seem challenging enough that people will want to participate, because if it's too easy, nobody will invest. Yesterday you came up with the idea of creating a "game of the mind" with the public, starting with making guesses in any form - numbers, dates, letters, characters, or words. You also mentioned something about "fan pods" but we haven't fully explored that part yet.

Did I capture everything correctly?
[20/10/2025 01:58] Tony Shelby: Your Idea Summary

Guessing game concept
[20/10/2025 02:00] Tony Shelby: Sure! Here are some entertaining and engaging ideas. First, a mystery number sequence where you post a few numbers like "3, 7, 15" and people pay to guess what comes next - winners split the prize pool. Second, a daily brain teaser where you post a fun riddle each day, people pay a small fee to submit answers, and correct guessers share that day's earnings. Third, a multi-day treasure hunt where you release cryptic clues over several days, participants pay to join the hunt, and whoever solves the final puzzle wins the jackpot.

These create excitement because people love solving puzzles and the anticipation builds engagement. Which one grabs your attention most?
[20/10/2025 02:00] Tony Shelby: I understand you want something that creates excitement and anxiety, but also accessible to everyone including those who aren't highly educated. How about a simple color or pattern prediction game? You could show a sequence of colors or symbols and people guess what comes next. Or maybe a "lucky number of the day" where people just pick any number between one and one hundred, and the closest guess wins. These are simple enough for anyone to participate but still create that anticipation and excitement you're looking for.

What do you think about keeping it really simple so everyone can join in?
[20/10/2025 02:01] Tony Shelby: Perfect! So you just post the results from these external, uncontrollable sources and that's it - no way for people to question your honesty. You could use multiple data sources too, like combining the last digits of different stock prices or weather readings from multiple cities to create the winning number.

This way you're just the messenger posting publicly verifiable results that you had zero control over. What kind of external data source appeals to you most for this concept?
[20/10/2025 02:01] Tony Shelby: You're right, I need to think bigger! What if you create something like "The Mystery Box Challenge" where you have people guess what's inside a locked box that gets opened by a random stranger you meet on the street? Or maybe "The Chaos Game" where multiple random events have to align - like guessing the exact minute a street performer will finish their act combined with what the next person to walk by will be wearing?

The entertainment comes from the unpredictability and multiple moving parts creating real drama and suspense. What would make you personally excited to watch unfold?
[20/10/2025 02:01] Tony Shelby: You're absolutely right - you need something revolutionary that's never been done before! Let me think of something truly groundbreaking...

What if you create "The Human Algorithm Game" where you become a living, breathing random number generator? People pay to participate, and the winning number is determined by your actual biometric data at an exact future moment - like your heart rate plus your body temperature plus your blood pressure readings at exactly three PM tomorrow, all measured live on camera with medical devices.

Nobody has ever used human vital signs as a lottery system before, it's completely unpredictable even to you, medically verifiable, and creates incredible suspense watching your actual body determine the winner in real time!
[20/10/2025 02:01] Tony Shelby: I understand - you need something that requires no funding but is still completely revolutionary and entertaining. Let me think of something that uses only what you already have...

What if you create "The Collective Consciousness Experiment" where you post a completely blank image, and people have to guess the exact word or image you'll mentally visualize while staring at it for exactly sixty seconds? The twist is you don't decide what to think about until that exact moment, making it impossible to predict or control.

This costs nothing, has never been done, creates massive intrigue about mind reading and consciousness, and is simple enough for anyone to participate in. Does this feel more revolutionary?
[20/10/2025 02:01] Tony Shelby: I hear you - you want something absolutely explosive and revolutionary! Let me think outside the box completely...

What if you create "The Reality Glitch Challenge" where people predict the exact moment something completely random and unexpected will happen in your daily life that you film continuously? Like predicting the exact second a bird will land near you, or when a stranger will accidentally drop something, or when you'll hear a car horn - all captured live with no staging possible.

The entertainment comes from watching real life unfold unpredictably while people try to predict the unpredictable moments of chaos that naturally happen around us every day!
[20/10/2025 02:02] Tony Shelby: Now I understand! You need something that happens automatically in the background that you can't control, but creates incredibly addictive and mysterious content that people can't stop watching and rewatching to figure out.

What if you create "The Digital Oracle" - a system where people submit questions or predictions, and the "answer" is determined by completely random digital events happening across the internet that you have no control over? Like the exact number of new YouTube videos uploaded globally in the next hour, or the precise number of tweets containing a specific word combination that doesn't exist yet?

Your posts would be cryptic and mysterious, showing just enough to hook people but making them work to understand the system and participate!
[20/10/2025 02:02] Tony Shelby: I see! The Digital Oracle idea is too complex for casual viewers. You want something instantly entertaining that grabs anyone's attention immediately, not something they have to study to understand.

Let me think of something that's visually exciting and instantly engaging but still runs automatically in the background. What kind of content naturally makes people stop scrolling and watch - something with immediate visual impact that creates instant curiosity?
[20/10/2025 02:02] Tony Shelby: Perfect! You want the Digital Oracle to be instantly understandable for everyone, but impossible for others to copy or steal from you. 

What if you create a unique signature system where the Digital Oracle is tied to something only you can access or control? Like using your specific social media account data, your unique phone number, or your personal digital footprint as part of the random generation process?

This way people understand the concept immediately, but they can't replicate it because it's locked to your unique digital identity. Does this solve both problems?
[20/10/2025 02:02] Tony Shelby: Sure! Here's the Digital Oracle concept again:

You create a system where people submit guesses or predictions, and the winning results come from completely random digital data happening across the internet that you can't control or predict. Things like the exact number of new videos uploaded to YouTube in the next hour, or how many tweets contain a specific random word combination.

The key is that this data generates automatically in the background without you doing anything, but you post the results in mysterious and attention-grabbing ways that make people curious. Since it's tied to your unique digital signature or accounts, others can't steal or replicate your exact system.

What part needs to be adjusted or what do you want to add to this concept?
[20/10/2025 02:02] Tony Shelby: Got it! Let me think of another easily verifiable data source that's different from weather and stocks.

What about using live sports data that everyone can check instantly? Like the exact final score of a major game, or the total number of goals scored across all soccer matches in a day, or even simpler - the exact number that shows up on a live lottery drawing that's broadcast publicly?

These numbers are completely random, impossible to predict or control, and millions of people watch them happen live so anyone can verify the results instantly. Does this direction work better?
[20/10/2025 02:03] Tony Shelby: I'm thinking! What about using the exact number of people currently online on a popular social media platform that displays live user counts, or the real-time vote counts on a trending poll that everyone can see, or even the live view count on a viral video at a specific predetermined time?

These numbers change constantly in real-time, are completely unpredictable, and anyone can check them instantly just by visiting the platform. What other type of live, public data are you looking for?
[20/10/2025 02:03] Tony Shelby: I need to think bigger! What about using live cryptocurrency prices at exact moments - like the precise price of Bitcoin down to the last decimal at exactly 3 PM, or the real-time number of active crypto transactions happening globally right now?

Or maybe live traffic data - like the exact number of cars currently on a specific highway that traffic apps show in real time, or the current wait time at popular restaurants that everyone can see on Google Maps?

What other type of live, unpredictable data would create more excitement and engagement?
[20/10/2025 02:03] Tony Shelby: Let me think of something completely different! What about using live news data - like the exact number of breaking news stories posted in the next hour on major news sites, or the precise number of comments on the most trending news article of the day?

Or maybe live entertainment data - like the exact number of new songs uploaded to Spotify today, or the total runtime in minutes of all movies released on Netflix this week?

These are constantly changing, completely unpredictable, and anyone can verify them easily. What other category of live data interests you more?
[20/10/2025 02:03] Tony Shelby: You're absolutely right! I'm making it too complicated. You need something much simpler and closer to people's daily lives.

What about using the exact time displayed on your phone when you take a screenshot at a random moment? Or the number of unread messages in your inbox at a specific time? Or even simpler - the last two digits of your phone's battery percentage at exactly noon tomorrow?

These are things everyone understands immediately, can relate to, and are completely random and unpredictable. Is this the kind of simple, close-to-home data you're looking for?
