# SIMPLER APPROACH: Pre-build WASM locally, then deploy

## ⚡ Quick Fix - Build WASM Locally

Run this on your machine first:

```bash
cd c:\Users\aship\Desktop\Digital Orael\Auctmah\frontend

# Install wasm-pack if you don't have it
cargo install wasm-pack

# Build WASM
wasm-pack build --target web --release

# This creates: pkg/ folder with WASM files
```

Then commit and push the `pkg/` folder to GitHub.

---

## Then on Render, just build Go

Create `render.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: auctmah
    runtime: go
    runtimeVersion: 1.22
    dir: Auctmah
    buildCommand: "go build -o app main.go"
    startCommand: "./app"
    envVars:
      - key: PORT
        value: "8080"
```

This way:
- ✅ WASM is pre-built (much faster)
- ✅ Only Go needs to compile on Render
- ✅ No internet access needed for wasm-pack
- ✅ Build completes in <2 minutes
